#  **Croqee 3D Asset Library**

This documentation is a tool that will help you getting started with the Croqee 3D Asset Library. It also explains the basics of working with Blender.

<br/> 

## **Technical notes** ##

---

Croqee's models are being rendered to approximate view of a person sitting in a real art studio. 

The current setup corresponds to a person sitting 2,5m away from the model. The eye height is 1,2m above ground. Focal length of the camera is 35mm. Reasons for this particular focal length are explained below.

<br/> 

### **Focal length & human vision** ###

<br/>

<br/> 

On a 35mm full-frame camera (36mm x 24mm frame size):

* A **10mm** lens has a 121.9° horizontal field of view (FOV), which corresponds to our full range of binocular vision.
  
* A **28mm** lens has a 65.5° FOV, which is a little wider than the area of focus, so it includes some peripheral vision.
  
* A **35mm** lens has a 54.4° FOV, which corresponds to the area of focus for two eyes.
  
* A **50mm** lens has a 39.6° FOV, which corresponds to the monocular vision from a single eye.
  
* A **70mm** lens has a 28.8° FOV which corresponds to the area of detail vision.

### **Understanding the interface** ###

Blender's interface may seem quite overwhelming at first, but once you understand what each part of it does, it becomes much clearer. To make this easier, you can refer to the graphic below.

2. Switch modes
3. Render tab
4. Viewport settings
5. Layers (Collections)
6. Properties selection tab

## Importing models ##

---

If you need to make a more complex scene, you might want to do it by joining multiple models from different files. This can be done by importing models into your current project. 

<br/>

<img src="images/append1.png" alt="Blender UI"
title="Blender UI" style="border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 0 0 5px #000;"/>

1. To import .blend object, you have to go to the **File** tab and select the **Append** option.

<br/>

<img src="images/append2.png" alt="Blender UI"
title="Blender UI" style="border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 0 0 5px #000;"/>

2. Then you'll have to navigate to your .blend file and open it.

<br/>

<img src="images/append3.png" alt="Blender UI"
title="Blender UI" style="border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 0 0 5px #000;"/>

3. Once you double click on the .blend file, you'll see a list of different folders. The one that you need to open is called **Mesh**. It stores the geometry of your object.

<br/>

<img src="images/append4.png" alt="Blender UI"
title="Blender UI" style="border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 0 0 5px #000;"/>

4. Last step is to select the file with geometry and click the **Append** button.

After all of this is done, you'll be able to see your new object in the layers panel (5) on the right.
